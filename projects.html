            <div class="panel-block-content">
                <p>Project Zeus was my team's capstone project. I was the lead programmer of the ACSL (Algonquin College Simulations Lab). Project Zeus is a space horror puzzle game built in Unreal Engine.</p>
                <p>After drifting in the void for 40 years, Rusty, an outdated maintenance droid, finally returns to the Astra Veritas, a once-thriving research and mining vessel. Decades of unchecked decay and corruption from Zeus—a mysterious, flesh-like substance created in secret experiments has twisted the station into a labyrinth of malfunctioning systems and horrifying creatures. Now, Rusty must navigate the wreckage, relying on his tools, adaptability, and determination to uncover what happened during his absence.</p>

            <div class="panel-block-content">
                <p>Bunny Bash was my team's mini-capstone project, where I was the lead programmer. Bunny Bash is a third-person, multiplayer, party game. The "bash" mechanic is inspired by the metroidvania series "Ori" where players send themselves one direction and another object/player the other way.</p>
                <p>This Project is currently under re-development. Using new knowledge and new team members to recreate the game we are passionate about.</p>

            <h1>Quad Tree</h1>
            <div class="panel-block-content">
                <p>Using a simple 2D framework, I implemented quadtree-based spatial partitioning to optimize collision detection for 1000 circles. Instead of checking every circle against every other one, which gets expensive fast, I used a quadtree to divide the space into regions and quickly narrow down which circles could potentially collide. This cut down the number of collision checks per frame significantly while keeping the detection accurate.</p>

                <p>Using a simple 2D framework, I implemented dungeon generation code. With configurable numbers to customize the final result. Uses AABB collision to seperate boxes. Delaunay Triagulation and Minimum spanning tree to create hallways between selected rooms.</p>

                <p>Before attending Algonquin College, I spent a lot of time teaching myself Unity and C#. This is one of my early projects. Standing on a platform shoot slimes with bouncing projectiles to collect points.</p>

            <h1>3D Pong</h1>
            <div class="panel-block-content">
                <p>Pong is one of the first games most people starting off coding make. Of course I made pong back in highschool but somewhere on the internet I ran into 3D pong. I thought it was fun and wondered how it worked. So here is my version of 3D pong. Apply spin to the ball with the direction the paddle is moving while making contact with the ball.</p>
